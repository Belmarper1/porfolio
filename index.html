        <h2>European Work Experiences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>SOUTIEN ÉDUCATIF PERSONNALISÉ</h3></li>
                    <p>November 2020-April 2021 (Limoges, France)</p>
                    <p>It was a EU program called 'Young Entrepreneurs'. I developed an enterprise strategy, and as it met the 
                    <br/>requirements, I was selected to implement the project with an established entrepreneur. This collaboration allowed
                    <br/> both of us to improve our strategies. I designed educational activities for children and adolescents with learning
                    <br/> difficulties, while also participating in the development of marketing strategies and handling administrative tasks.</p>
            
            <li><h3>FUNDACJA CENTRUM AKTYWNOSCI TWÓRCZEJ</h3></li>
                    <p>November 2018-October 2019 (Leszno, Poland)</p>
                    <p>I participated in the 'European Voluntary Service,' which is an EU program that allows individuals to engage in 
                    <br/>volunteer work in exchange for accommodation, funds for meals, and some pocket money. There, I worked in several events
                    <br/> and workshops, either as a developer or assistant, collaborating in both group and independent projects related to 
                    <br/>environmental issues, equality, cultures, and languages. I also took on responsibilities such as coordinating, supporting,
                    <br/> and assisting with daily challenges and the integration of short-term volunteers who came and went every two months.</p>
